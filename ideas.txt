Ideas:

1. Create default option which is on for all simulations of certain type
    a. No user intervention and works in all use-cases
    b. Easy API to integrate into postprocessing code

2. Add flag for detailed or user-feedback data extraction (for good models)

3. Ability to add to 2 different appls in same script,
    or same appl in 2 different scripts (not same time)

4. Prompt user input before simulation: "What changed?"
    a. User input name and value of change

5. include info about using sqlite-web to browse and export



Folder Structure:

/.../storedata/{appl}
/.../storedata/{appl}/live
/.../storedata/{appl}/live/{timestamp(MS)}
/.../storedata/{appl}/live/{timestamp(MS)}/{contents}
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/{full.sqlite}
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/daily
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/daily/{yymmdd.sqlite}
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/artifacts/
/.../storedata/{appl}/db/artifacts/{yymmdd}/{MS}/{contents}


[FUTURE] SQLite Process:

1. Each run saved in timestamped folder in "live" directory
    a. Parameters saved in CSV file called "storedata_params.csv"
    b. Artifacts in same folder with filename referenced in "params.csv"

2. Daily scheduled process to convert params and artifacts to .sqlite
    a. Convert each run and add to a daily database
    b. Merge new daily database with full history database
    c. Keep track of db merges with DVC (or similar tool)?
    d. 4 options for special data: file, zip, blob, or json

3. Create sub-table in db if repeated values are present in column
